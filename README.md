# Top and Tail Stitcher

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Use Case Information 
* Editors will need to ensure that tops are created ~6s with no fadeout
* Only tested with 1920x1080 (MP4) 
* output directory will be cleared at the start of each run

## üìã TODO
* ~~get the Elicia Salzberg video for COMM 101~~
* ~~Do fades to white programmatically on top assets (tail is constant)~~
* Bring specifications table up to new standard
* Get all video assets needed for new testing
* Look into the Panopto API -- clarify with Altan, with every completed video we should be making a session?

## ü§î Possible Features
* Jamie mentioned something about an additional title slide? Like a course slide then a section slide?
* Body addition (optional - if we already have the body we can add it to the edit)
    * Watermark addition: Ability to specify which watermark to use and placement (bottom left vs bottom right)
    * Programmatically cross-dissolve between top and tail?
* Panopto integration and uploading (nice-to-have but could be time consuming)

## Notes

* tier1: prebuild courses (prior to content)
* watermarking is going to be key (2 watermarks)
* get it on GitHub and add everyone:
    * shoekey4811
    * unabridgedxcrpt

Does it have a body?

Yes? Does it have a watermark?

Yes? Where does the watermark go?


Seems like it's possible to build out folder hierarchies & make sessions using the Panopto API
