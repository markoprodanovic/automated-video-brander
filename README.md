# Top and Tail Stitcher

üö® PRIVATE REPO DO NOT SHARE üö®
This repo will be publicly published when we have a stable **Version 1**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Use Case Information 
* Editors will need to ensure that tops are created ~6s (working on automating this part as well)
* Only works with **1920x1080 (MP4)**
* `/output` directory will be cleared at the start of each run
* Body should be a single video clip with ~3 seconds before/after the spaeker speaks
* Watermark position defaults to bottom-right -- bottom left only if WatermarkPosition is **L** or **l** (in CSV)

## CSV
Any of the following values will be treated as NULL on CSV:

* empty cell
* empty string: '' (FALSY)

## Whoever is runing should have a basic understanding of:

* How to run a python script via the command line (for whatever OS you're using)
* How to setup and manage an environment using conda given a `environment.yml`
* How to keep their version up-to-date using GitHub (or GitHub Desktop)
    * Note you don't need to use GitHub but then you're responsible for keeping your version up to date manually
