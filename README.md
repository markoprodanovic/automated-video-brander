## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Use Case Information 
* Editors will need to ensure that tops are created ~6s (working on automating this part as well)
* Only works with **1920x1080 (MP4)**
* `/output` directory will be cleared at the start of each run
* Body should be a single video clip with ~3 seconds before/after the spaeker speaks
* Watermark position defaults to bottom-right -- bottom left only if WatermarkPosition is **L** or **l** (in CSV)
* Only supports single line titles (titles can not exceed 45 characters)

## CSV
Any of the following values will be treated as NULL on CSV:

* empty cell
* empty string: '' (FALSY)
* zero: 0 (FALSY)
* type = nan OR type = None
* 'null' OR 'NULL'
* 'none' OR 'NONE'

## Whoever is runing should have a basic understanding of:

* How to run a python script via the command line (for whatever OS you're using)
* How to setup and manage an environment using conda given a `environment.yml`
